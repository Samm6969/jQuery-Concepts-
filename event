//The event object contains more information about an event, 
//such as which mouse button was clicked or which key was pressed.

//$(document) selects the whole web page, and the .keypress() method attaches an event handler to document.

$(document).keypress(function(event) {
  if(event.which === 109) {
    $('.dropdown-menu').toggle();
  }
});

//here, The event handler takes event as a parameter.
//event.which contains which key was pressed. Keyboard keys are identified by key codes. 
//The m key is identified by the key code 109.

Another Example: 
var main = function() {
  $(document).keypress(function(event) {
   if(event.which === 103) {
   $(".btn").toggleClass("btn-like");
    }
  });
};

$(document).ready(main);
